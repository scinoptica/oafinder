## Academic Search Engines

*	[**1findr**] (https://1findr.1science.com/home)
Index: scientific documents, especially Open Access works, currently about 90 million documents, 27 million of them Open Access, all of them peer-reviewed journal articles, but other document types are to be added in the future.
Checked 2018-07-17
*	[**BASE**], https://www.base-search.net/, Bielefeld University's Open Access search engine. Since BASE does not only provide records of Open Access content, the search options should be adapted in such a way that - as far as possible - only Open Access documents are displayed as results.
*	[**Google Scholar**], https://scholar.google.com/, indicates Open Access documents by the reference [PDF] or[HTML] in the result list. Especially the marking [HTML] can be deceptive, because sometimes only parts of a work, e.g. a book, are visible in Google Books.
*	[**Microsoft Academic**](https://academic.microsoft.com/) lists the links found for a Open Access publication under "Sources", for overview pages a link to the paper (if found) is provided under "Download".
*	[**Semantic Scholar**](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) often delivers directly PDFs or alternatively a link to a PDF.
*	[**CORE**](https://core.ac.uk/) aggregates Open Access publications from repositories and journals worldwide.


## Browser-Plug-ins

*	The browser plug-in [**unpaywall.org**], http://unpaywall.org/, (available for Firefox and Chrome browsers) automatically directs to available Open Access versions if your institution has no access to a publication.
*	The [**Open Access Button**], https://openaccessbutton.org/, can be used as a search engine as well as a browser plug-in. If an Open Access version of published content does not yet exist, plug-in users can send an e-mail to the author of the publication and ask for an Open Access version to be made available. If you search via the web interface and do not receive a hit, you will also find a way to contact the author.
*	The plug-in [**Kopernio**], https://kopernio.com/, (also available for Firefox and Chrome browsers) also supports the search for Open Access documents. Kopernio will search for an alternative version, e.g. a preprint or another version that can be used in Open Access. 
* The [**Google Scholar Button**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-scholar-button/ldipcbpaocekfooobnbcddclnhejkcpn?hl=en) is a browser extension (available for Firefox and Chrome browsers) that makes searching Google Scholar easier: Mark the title of the publication you are looking for on any website - by clicking on the GS button a small window opens which lists search results from Google Scholar and marks whether full text is available as PDF or HTML.

## Resolver

* The alternative DOI resolver[**DOAI**], http://doai.io/, enables direct access to an Open Access version: Simply attach the DOI of the required publication to the URL[doai.io](http://doai.io/) - or use the search function on the website.
